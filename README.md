### PlayNoise Web App - Voice-to-Instrument Conversion Website

PlayNoise Web App is an interactive website that allows users to convert their voice recordings into musical instruments directly in their browser. Using PlayNoise.js, this site enables you to:

- **Record your voice** and transform it into musical sounds.
- **Choose from a variety of instruments** such as Banjo, Guitar, and Trumpet.
- **Download your converted audio** as a WAV file after processing.

The website offers an easy-to-use interface where users can upload their voice recordings, select an instrument, and listen to the transformation of their voice into a new, instrument-like sound. This project integrates HTML, PHP, and JavaScript to handle audio processing and seamless user interaction.
